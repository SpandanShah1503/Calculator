# Calculator Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 💻🧮

I’m excited to share a project I’ve been working on — a **Digital Calculator** with a creative and user-friendly UI.

While it may seem like a simple tool, this calculator represents a big milestone in my web development journey. It was built using three core web technologies:

- **HTML** – to create the structure and layout of the calculator.
- **CSS** – to design a visually appealing, modern, and responsive UI.
- **JavaScript** – to bring interactivity and logic to life by handling user input and performing calculations.

### ✨ Highlights
- Fully functional calculator with basic arithmetic operations.
- Creative, clean, and user-centric UI design.
- Real-time display updates and button interactions.

### 📁 Tech Stack
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
