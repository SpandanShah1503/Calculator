**Project Name - Calculator Using HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT With a creative UI.**

I’m excited to share with you a project I’ve been working on: a digital calculator. This may seem like a simple tool, but it represents a significant step in my journey as a web developer. To build this calculator, I utilized the power of three core technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provided the structural foundation, defining the layout and content of the calculator. CSS, on the other hand, added the visual appeal, styling the buttons, display, and overall appearance. The real magic, however, lies in JavaScript. This dynamic language brought the calculator to life, enabling it to perform calculations, update the display, and respond to user input. Designed and developed a calculator with a user-centric UI.
